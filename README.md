# minishell
A minishell project is a project that involves creating a simple command-line shell, similar to the shells that are commonly used on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and MacOS. A minishell typically has a limited set of features and is intended as a learning exercise rather than a full-featured shell.

In a minishell project, you might be asked to implement the following features:

    Basic command execution: The minishell should be able to execute simple commands such as ls and cd, either by calling the corresponding executable or by implementing the functionality directly in the shell.

    Command-line arguments: The minishell should be able to handle arguments passed to commands, such as ls -l or cd /path/to/dir.

    Built-in commands: The minishell should include a set of built-in commands, such as exit and echo, that do not rely on external executables.

    Environment variables: The minishell should support the use of environment variables, which are variables that can be set and accessed by the shell and by programs run within the shell.

    Redirection and pipes: The minishell should support the use of redirection operators, such as > and <, and pipes, which allow the output of one command to be used as the input to another command.
